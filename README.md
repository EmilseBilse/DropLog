# Drop Log
The Drop Log plugin is designed to keep track of items the player has intentionally dropped during their session. Unlike traditional drop trackers that focus on loot from monsters, Drop Log offers a unique perspective by logging the items players drop, helping manage inventory decisions and understand their dropping habits better.

## Features

- **Drop Logging**: Automatically logs every item you drop during a session, providing a list including item names, quantities, and total value.
- **Interactive Drop Log**: Right-click on any entry in the drop log to remove the item from the log or adjust its quantity, providing flexibility in managing your drop data.
- **Session Management**: Easily toggle between viewing items dropped in the current session and those dropped in all sessions since the plugin was installed.
- **Sort and Filter**: Sort your drop log by item name, quantity, or value. Filter the log to find specific items quickly.
- **Data Persistence**: Dropped items are saved locally, allowing you to review your drop history even after restarting the game client.

## Usage

After enabling Drop Log, the plugin will automatically start tracking items you drop. To view your drop log, click on the Drop Log panel icon in the RuneLite sidebar.

- **Toggle Session View**: Use the "Show Current Session" or "Show All Items" button at the top of the drop log panel to switch between viewing modes.
- **Sorting**: Click on the column headers in the drop log to sort by that attribute.
- **Modifying Entries**: Right-click on a drop log entry to either remove it from the log or adjust the dropped quantity.
